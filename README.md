# MERN-Stack Template


A MERN-stack template environment useful for getting new ideas up off the ground, and running quickly.

## Quick start

<!-- Note this is important to list:  -->
1. If you don't already have it installed, you'll need to install MongoDB. If you have Homebrew installed, the easiest way to get started is running, `brew install mongodb`. For other installation options, see the link to MongoDB's website below.
2. Start MongoDB, `mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` (your own config file path may vary)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Build front-end code with webpack in watch mode by running `npm run build-js`
5. Start express server by running `npm start`

**That's it! Navigate to http://localhost:8080, and you're ready to start developing!**

## Testing

The Jest testing framework is used for both front, and back-end tests and can be started by running:
```sh
npm test
```
