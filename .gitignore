# Ideally, this would live in `.npmignore`, not `.gitignore`, since your intention is to not upload snapshots to the source repo
# end users work with, but end users _should_ check-in Jest snapshots (they are meant to be reviewed). Thinking quickly, this is tricky,
# though, since this is not exactly like a library that is a good fit for NPM. You may just want to include a comment to remove this from
# the gitignore, and include an instruction in the README.MD.

# coverage is created by Jest in your app, so better to just put this directly below `*__snapshots__` (no need to mention instanbul)
